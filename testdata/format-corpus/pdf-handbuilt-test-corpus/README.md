## About this folder

This folder contains a handbuilt PDF set created as part of an ipres2017 paper.
The data set presents a corpus of light-weight files designed to test the validation criteria of JHOVE's PDF module against "well-formedness". Test cases are based on structural requirements for PDF files as per ISO 32000-1:2008 standard. It currently only tests against 88 different cases.
